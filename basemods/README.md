Bacterial_Basemod_Analysis
==========================

This repository contains R functions and a walk-through example of using those functions to do additional custom analysis of basemodification data output by SMRTPortal.  The functions are focused on studying methylation patterns in methyltransferase recognition motifs commonly found in bacterial genomes.
